Neovim Configuration

All this configuration is based (or should I say copied) from ChristianChiarulli.
See the gihub here: https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch
He also has the best tutorial for Neovim setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ&index=2)
